THE PROCESS OF MAKING HTBWAC

STEP 1: STARTING SMALL
The code initially started with a basic HTML layout of buttons and text with an initial physical drawing of what should be the initial goal. Once the layout started to look the way it should, the next step was to insert empty div's provide the layout of how the trajectory of the game should go.

STEP 2: IMPLEMENTING IF ELSE
The next step was to implement the main function to how the game should run. Starting with an intial if else statement of when the choices should stop and what happens when it does. After the main function was up and running, other commands were filled in to take you through other options that were continued to by other nested if else statements.

STEP 3: ADDING SOUNDBYTES AND IMAGES
All images were Appended through the DOM using photos uploaded to the GitHub repository. Experimented with an AI art generator that arranged the background used.Sound clips were also added to the repository over URLs and some were edited and converted in Logic Pro.

STEP 4: CLEANING THE MACHINE
Cleaning up the functionality of the game and limiting the decision making process without feeling the options were limited was most of the work put into this game. Hiding buttons, appending new choices allows the energy to carry on without the user realizing there are dead stops in the game. Media queries were also a huge aspect to make sure everyone can use the app no matter where the user is viewing the page from.

STEP 5: ADDING EXTRA FEATURES AND CLEANING UP UNUSED CODE
Implementing sound effects, music and settings using same logic of the main game using basic HTML, CSS, and adding new calls in JavaScript.
