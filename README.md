# hit-the-buzzer-win-a-cookie
Unit 1 project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

A riveting game of chance where one hits a buzzer and possibly wins a cookie. 

Press the buzzer and choose either a sugar or chocolate chip cookie. 

Choose wisely! You can only have 9 cookies on your plate! The caveat is you can eat as many as your stomach can handle.

THE PROCESS OF MAKING HTBWAC

STEP 1: (implementing main frame, assigning constants, creating if else to work counter)

STEP 2: (implementing if else to count down)

STEP 3: ADDING SOUNDBYTES AND IMAGES: Appended the images throught the DOM using photos uploaded to the GitHub repository. Experimented with an AI art generator that arranged the background used.Sound clips were also added to the repository over URLs and some were edited and converted in Logic Pro.

STEP 4: CLEANING THE MACHINE
queries and debugging

STEP 5: 
music choices and settings
